The OSTrails Commons
--------------------

The OSTrails Commons (referred to also as ‘the Commons’ hereafter) is a set of open, reusable digital objects that guide and simplify the inclusion of tools into the federation of interoperable services within OSTrails This repository is a living record of the standards, schemas, API definitions, and code modules that make up the OSTrails commons.

The Commons is built through iterative cycles, where specifications will evolve (either individually or in synchrony with other components of The Commons) to incorporate feedback from tool developers and other stakeholders. This iterative approach ensures that the Commons remains practical and adaptable. For this reason, entities in the commons are carefully versioned, and versioned releases are generated as required to ensure that the tools work together.

The Commons is guided by the Plan-Track-Assess Pathways defined by OSTrails, which provides a map of how tools interact to facilitate research workflows. The pathways flow through three primary Interoperability Frameworks (IF): the SKG-IF, the DMP-IF, and the FAIR-IF.  As such, this living repository is similarly split into three chapters with the same names, containing the detailed record of the members of that sub-set of Commons artefacts.
